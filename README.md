Apache HTTP Server (Apache) is one of the most popular and widely used open-source web servers.

What does Apache do?

•	It serves web content (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) to users over the internet.

•	It supports virtual hosting, so you can host multiple websites on the same server.

•	It can handle both static and dynamic content (like PHP pages).

Why use Apache?

•	Free and open-source

•	Highly configurable and flexible

•	Works with most platforms and CMS tools (like WordPress)

•	Reliable and battle-tested

Does nginx accept dynamic content?

  NGINX does not natively process dynamic content (like PHP, Python, or Node.js applications) within its own worker processes. Instead, it acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests for dynamic content to a separate, specialized application server that handles the processing.
